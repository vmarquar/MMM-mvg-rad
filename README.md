# MMM-mvg-rad
This is a Magic Mirror 2 module, that lists all available rental bikes from MVG Rad (Munich Public Transport).

The module allows to filter for a given area around a specified location. It displays either a table with `bike number`, `distance to walk` and `direction`, or displays a map with the bikes.
